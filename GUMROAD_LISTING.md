## Full Product Description (Gumroad body)

### Free Prompt Libraries Give You Prompts. PromptVault Gives You Automation.

### Who Is This For?

- **Software engineers** who want AI automation that runs on its own, not prompts they have to babysit
- **Solo developers** who need to automate code review, documentation, and QA without hiring
- **Tech leads** who want team-wide AI workflows (not everyone crafting their own prompts)
- **Freelancers** who need to deliver faster without sacrificing quality
- **Engineering managers** building AI-augmented development practices

### Who Is This NOT For?

- People who have never used AI coding assistants (start with free tiers first)
- Teams that already have mature internal AI automation
- Anyone looking for prompt injection attacks or jailbreaks (this is for building, not breaking)

---

### What Makes This Different

**It's not just prompts. It's automation.**

Free libraries give you text to copy-paste into ChatGPT. PromptVault gives you working Python and JavaScript code with CLI interfaces, file I/O, git integration, and error handling.

**Copy the script. Add your API key. Run it.**

That's the PromptVault difference. Working AI automation in 60 seconds, not prompts you have to manually run every time.

**Comprehensive, not clever.**

Each prompt is a detailed, structured framework that tells the AI exactly what to look for, how to format output, and what to prioritize. The difference between "review my code" and a PromptVault review prompt is the difference between a rubber stamp and a real senior engineer review.

**Model-agnostic.**

The example scripts use Claude (Anthropic API), but you can swap in OpenAI, Google, or any other provider. The prompts themselves work with any instruction-following LLM. No lock-in.

**Customizable.**

Every prompt and script is designed to be modified. Change the prompts, add streaming, pipe to other tools, integrate with your stack. Make them your own.

---

### FAQ

**Q: Do I need to know Python or JavaScript?**
A: Basic familiarity helps, but the scripts are simple and well-commented. If you can run `python script.py`, you can use these. Customization requires light coding.

**Q: Will these scripts work with ChatGPT / OpenAI?**
A: Yes. The example scripts use Claude, but swapping to OpenAI takes 2 lines of code. The prompts themselves are model-agnostic and work with any LLM.

**Q: Can I share these with my team?**
A: Yes. A single purchase covers your entire team with unlimited seats. Share in your wiki, Notion, GitHub, or wherever your team works.

**Q: What format are the prompts in?**
A: Clean Markdown files, organized by category. Copy the prompt from the code block and paste into your AI assistant.

**Q: Will I get updates?**
A: Yes. As AI models evolve and new use cases emerge, new workflows and prompts are added. All purchasers receive lifetime updates at no additional cost.

**Q: What if I'm not satisfied?**
A: If the workflows don't save you time in the first week, email for a full refund. No questions asked.
