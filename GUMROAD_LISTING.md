## Full Product Description (Gumroad body)

### Stop Wasting Time Writing Prompts From Scratch

You already know AI can 10x your productivity. But here is the problem: **writing a good prompt takes longer than doing the task yourself.**

You paste your code into ChatGPT, type "review this code," and get back a generic response that misses the actual bugs. Or you ask for tests and get a handful of happy-path cases with no edge coverage.

**PromptVault fixes this.** It is a library of 64 meticulously crafted prompts organized by developer workflow. Each prompt has been refined through hundreds of real-world uses to produce specific, actionable, production-quality output.

### What Makes These Prompts Different

**They are comprehensive, not clever one-liners.** Each prompt is a detailed, structured framework that tells the AI exactly what to look for, how to format output, and what to prioritize. The difference between "review my code" and a PromptVault review prompt is the difference between a rubber stamp and a real senior engineer review.

**They include real output examples.** Every prompt shows you what good output looks like, so you can evaluate whether the AI nailed it or needs another pass.

**They are customizable.** Every prompt ends with "Tips for Customization" showing you how to adapt it for your tech stack (React, Django, Go, whatever), your team conventions, and your specific use case.

**They work with ANY AI model.** Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama, Mistral -- these prompts produce great results on any instruction-following model. No lock-in.

---

### Who Is This For?

- **Software engineers** who use AI daily and want dramatically better output
- **Tech leads** who want to set a quality bar for AI-assisted code review
- **Solo developers** and **freelancers** who need to wear every hat (QA, DevOps, PM, DBA) and want AI to help
- **Engineering managers** building AI-augmented team workflows
- **Bootcamp grads** who want to write code at a senior level from day one

### Who Is This NOT For?

- People who have never used an AI coding assistant (start with the free tiers first)
- Teams that already have a mature internal prompt library
- Anyone looking for prompt injection attacks or jailbreaks (this is for building, not breaking)

---

### The Math

A senior engineer costs $75-150/hour. If PromptVault saves you **one hour per week** (and it will save far more), it pays for itself in the first week. Every week after that is pure upside.
