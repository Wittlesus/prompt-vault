## How to Use

### Quick Start (30 seconds)

1. Browse the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) to find your category
2. Open the category file and find the prompt you need
3. Copy the prompt from the code block
4. Replace the `[PLACEHOLDER]` sections with your actual code/context
5. Paste into Claude, ChatGPT, or your preferred AI assistant
6. Read the "Tips for Customization" to refine the output

### Getting the Best Results

**Be specific with placeholders.** The prompts have placeholders like `[PASTE YOUR CODE HERE]`. The more context you provide, the better the output:

```
Bad:  [paste code here] -> pastes a 5-line function
Good: [paste code here] -> pastes the full file with imports, types, and related functions
```

**Use the customization tips.** Every prompt ends with "Tips for Customization" that show you how to adapt it for your specific tech stack, team practices, and use case.

**Chain prompts together.** Some powerful workflows combine multiple prompts:

1. Use **Edge Case Identifier** (Testing #3) to find gaps
2. Feed those edge cases into **Unit Test Generator** (Testing #1)
3. Run **Code Review** (Code Review #10) on the full PR before merging

### Which AI Model Should I Use?

These prompts work with any modern AI assistant. Recommendations:

| Model | Best For |
|-------|----------|
| Claude (Sonnet/Opus) | Code review, debugging, architecture docs. Excellent at following structured output formats. |
| ChatGPT (GPT-4) | Documentation, product writing, competitive analysis. Strong at persuasive, reader-friendly text. |
| Any model | All prompts are model-agnostic. Try your preferred model first. |
